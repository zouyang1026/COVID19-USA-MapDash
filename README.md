# COVID-19 Cases in the United States - Thematic Map Visualization

This project, developed by Zhanpeng Ouyang, presents a thematic map visualization of COVID-19 cases across the United States for the year 2020. It aims to provide a detailed and interactive representation of the spread and impact of COVID-19 at the county level.

## Visualization Type

The chosen method for this visualization is a proportional symbol map. This type was selected over a choropleth map for several reasons:
- **Accuracy in Representation**: Proportional symbols can more precisely depict the number of cases in each area, providing clarity where choropleth maps might generalize or average data over a region.
- **Immediate Visual Impact**: The use of varying symbol sizes allows for an intuitive grasp of the situation, making it easier to identify areas with higher case counts at a glance.
- **Flexibility and Scalability**: This approach can easily accommodate a wide range of data magnitudes, from small clusters to widespread outbreaks, without losing visual coherence.

## Interactive Features

To enhance the user experience and provide deeper insights, the map includes the following interactive features:
- **Zoom and Pan**: Users can explore different regions in detail.
- **Clickable Symbols**: Clicking on a symbol reveals specific data for each county, such as total cases and deaths.
- **Dynamic Sidebar**: The sidebar updates to reflect information about the visible area of the map, including a bar chart visualization of total cases.
